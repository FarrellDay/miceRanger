Description: Multiple Imputation has been shown to 
  be a flexible method to impute missing values by 
  Van Buuren (2007) <doi:10.1177/0962280206074463>. 
  Expanding on this, random forests have been shown 
  to be an accurate model by Stekhoven and Buhlmann 
  <arXiv:1105.0828> to impute missing values in datasets. 
  They have the added benefits of returning out of bag 
  error and variable importance estimates, as well as 
  being simple to run in parallel.
